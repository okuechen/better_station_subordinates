# Better Station Subordinates
This is a X4: Foundations mod for more efficient station subordinates (miner and trader). 

Main purpose is to avoid idle subordinates, like miners just waiting for a good spot to mine, and trader that just wait for insufficiant or critical wares, instead of moving on if they can't find them. With just small changes on the ai scripts. Should be highly compatible and no dependencies.

## How to install:

Simply move the content if this repository into a folder in your X4 extensions folder. For example (if using steam):

***
    C:\Steam\steamapps\common\X4 Foundations\extensions\better_station_subordinates\
***

Be warned though, that station traders tend to priorize buying over selling now, and usage in general is at own risk.
